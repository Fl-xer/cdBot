# An excellent state of the art leveling system, tested and approved

Our state of the art leveling system has been tested and approved by professionals. There is no buisness of going to another website to see the leaderboard, everythings right in Discord, and the bot understands spam, so that means your server members cant spam to get points like you can in other bots! (Psst, you can use auto-mod to stop spam!) The leveling system comes on by default, ready to use, or you can manually set it up/or turn it off if it is not needed.
