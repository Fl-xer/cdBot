# xCDx Discord Bot

xCDx Discord Bot is an multi-purpose Discord Bot, loaded with features and interesting advanced tools.

To list a few, we have:

# An Advanced Giveaways system that can help you host your giveaways for free

Our Giveaway system can help you create and manage an giveaway for free, 
easily, and with one of the most powerful and advanced giveaway systems we have created.
It takes about thirty seconds to create an giveaway, all you have to do is send a message in 
this format: >gstart (channel) (duration) (number of winners) (what you are giving away)
and replace the variables with your own. xCDx will then create a giveaway, and boom your set to go!


# Powerful Moderation Commands to keep your server squeaky clean

We have many powerful moderation commands that keep your server clean from spam/bad words/mass pings and more. A few to mention are, >purge preventing anyone to spam and mass ping, profanity filter, >warn to warn a user, kick, to kick a user, >ban to ban and user and so on. Our Moderation system is very powerful and was reviwed to rival bots like MEE6, Dyno, and more 

# An excellent state of the art leveling system, tested and approved

Our state of the art leveling system has been tested and approved by professionals. There is no buisness of going to another website to see the leaderboard, everythings right in Discord, and the bot understands spam, so that means your server members cant spam to get points like you can in other bots! (Psst, you can use auto-mod to stop spam!) The leveling system comes on by default, ready to use, or you can manually set it up/or turn it off if it is not needed. 

# Quicky and easy logging, so you know exactly whats happening in your server

Quicky and easly you can set up logging for many different things, like:
- Invite logging
- Member Join/Leave logging
- Channel Create/Update/Delete logging
- Emoji Create/Update/Delete Logging
- Ban logging
- Member Updates Logging for Roles and Nickname
- Message Update/Delete/Purge Logging

Best of all, it does not take more than 5 minutes to set it up! All you have to do is choose your channel, choose what things you want to log, and not log, and done!

# Invite tracking so you know who invited who, and can reward them

Invite tracking, one of our best features! 

- Tracks users invites by invite urls
- Sends welcome message that displays user that joined along with who invited them in a given channel

Our bot can easily track who invited who, and using our reward command, you can reward them an role so they feel proud of their hard work. OR, you can also choose they win for an giveaway your doing, so they feel rewarded still!

# An application command so you can have people apply right through Discord

Our application feature is one of our best features ever! Though it is a bit complex (one of the only commands that are complex in our bot) it is still really advanced and an interesting new tool. You set up yes/no, long answer, short answer questions, up to 100 questions per application which are saved in an channel made by the bot called Questions-Channel. The people that want to join do >apply (application name), and answer the questions, and after they submit the application, it is sent to an channel called archive which is also made by the bot. You can accept, deny, or remove the application there. You may ask what is the difference between deny and remove, the difference is that if you apply or deny the application, it stays in the archive channel, but if you remove it gets removed from the archive channel. 

# Welcome messages, leave messages, kick messages, and ban messages

# Profanity filter that blocks **500 different words**

Our profanity filter is an advanced filter that blocks about 500 words, and it can be toggled by an simple click. If you want to see which words we block, you can go [here](https://github.com/web-mech/badwords/blob/master/lib/lang.json). The bot will delete all messages that are sent by members (excluding people with Administrator permissions) which contain these words. Of course, you can toggle it off, but we **highly recommend you keep it on, to keep a safe community for your Discord Server.** The filter comes on by default. 

# 24/7 hosting, so you have the bot when you need it
